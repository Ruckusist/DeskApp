# Deskapp Server

This server is so bad. This is not for production use. This is 
a server that ought be, when fleshed out, a great way to transfer files, chat,
host a game, hold a login database for web/game.


# TODO:

[ ] Wrap all this up into a docker before it gets to crazy.

[ ] refactor this so that the callback system is entirely in the engine.

[ ] DO NOT TRANSFER THE PICKLES. this has been proven to hacked. I have no
    idea how to make this unhackable, and this needs to be changed into
    json. there is nothing that the json cant do at this point, and before,
    this project moves much further, this needs to be patched.

[ ] Provide an example connector in as many languages as possible. start with
    typescript/javascript ideas. then maybe a node library.


# CHANGELOG
11.11.22 Ruckusist- First migrated this project to the deskapp namespace.
    this is good and technically working. ready for forwards progress.
