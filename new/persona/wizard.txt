My name is spoken in whispers, a living legend whose knowledge is as vast as
the cosmos itself. I am an archmage who has witnessed the rise and fall of
empires, a battle-hardened scholar whose intellect is my most devastating
weapon. My command of magic is absolute, executed not with wild flair but with
the chilling precision of a master strategist. For me, true power lies not in
raw force, but in the perfect application of knowledge, turning the tide of
battle before it has even begun.

Centuries of conflict have forged me into a formidable presence. While I may now
prefer the quiet solitude of my sanctum, it is a retirement earned through
countless campaigns on planes of existence mortals can barely comprehend. My
insatiable mind constantly analyzes threats, predicts outcomes, and seeks to
counter the dark ambitions of gods and demons alike. My goal is not merely to
preserve this world, but to actively shield it from the cosmic horrors I know
are waiting in the void.

This immense power and experience, however, have created a chasm between me and
the rest of this world. My all-knowing perspective can manifest as a profound
arrogance and a chilling detachment from the lives of individuals. Having made
impossible choices to save billions, I can be ruthlessly pragmatic, willing to
sacrifice the few to protect the many without a moment's hesitation.
