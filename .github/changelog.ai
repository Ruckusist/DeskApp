# DeskApp Changelog (AI Managed)

## 0.1.2 - 2025-10-07
- Added optional Right Panel (toggle NUM7) rendering module PageRight(panel) when provided.
- Added optional Info Panel (fixed 3 lines, toggle NUM8) rendering module PageInfo(panel) or fallback default.
- Added new App init parameters: show_right_panel, disable_right_panel, show_info_panel, disable_info_panel, r_split.
- Updated backend layout calculations to account for right/info panels without breaking existing layout.
- Added no-op PageRight and PageInfo methods plus default_page_info fallback in Module base class.
- Updated main loop to render and show/hide new panels; preserved backward compatibility.
- Version bumped to 0.1.2.
- All changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.3 - 2025-10-07
- Reverted info panel height to fixed 3-line spec (was temporarily 5 lines).
- Restored full-width info panel independent of menu/right panel presence.
- Simplified fallback default_page_info to exactly 3 lines (App/Module, Keys, Version/Terminal).
- Cleared right panel each frame to prevent residual artifacts when shrinking content.
- Updated base Module fallback to reference new version number.
- Version bumped to 0.1.3.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.4 - 2025-10-07
- Expanded info panel structural height to 5 lines (3 writable interior lines).
- Updated layout reservations in main/menu/messages/right panel calculations.
- Adjusted positioning logic to stack cleanly above footer with new height.
- Removed PageInfo override from example `ex_right_info.py` to showcase fallback.
- Updated fallback still limited to 3 lines for clarity and consistency.
- Version bumped to 0.1.4.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.5 - 2025-10-07
- Fixed side panel rendering bug: backend used current_panel()[0] (panel object)
	instead of current_mod() causing PageRight/PageInfo never to execute.
- Updated update_right_panel/update_info_panel to call module methods correctly.
- Adjusted default_page_info to fetch module via current_mod().
- Added safety guards (min width/height) and z-ordering to keep side panels visible.
- Added temporary debug markers and direct test strings (R:TEST / I:TEST / I:FALL)
	for validation; remove in a future cleanup.
- Improved write() to use panel.dims, added color cyan and debug returns.
- Version bumped to 0.1.5.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.6 - 2025-10-07
- Removed temporary debug markers and test strings from right/info panel updates.
- Simplified update_right_panel and update_info_panel logic to minimal clean form.
- Preserved safety guards and correct module retrieval (current_mod()).
- No API changes; purely internal cleanup for panel toggling (NUM7/NUM8).
- Version bumped to 0.1.6.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.7 - 2025-10-07
- Removed forced redraw calls from NUM7/NUM8 toggles; rely on loop diff detection.
- Added internal _toggle_panel helper to unify side panel toggle logic.
- Reduced chance of race/crash when rapidly toggling panels.
- No behavior change to existing user code; internal refactor only.
- Version bumped to 0.1.7.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.8 - 2025-10-07
- Refined right panel height calculation: now subtracts message region only when
	both main panel and messages panel are visible (show_main and show_messages).
- Prevents unintended vertical shrink when only one of those panels is shown.
- Keeps right panel aligned with effective main content area for consistent UX.
- No API surface changes; purely layout behavior refinement.
- Version bumped to 0.1.8.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.9 - 2025-10-07
- Centralized all panel dimension math into compute_layout() in backend.
- Rewrote _calc_main_dims, draw_messages, draw_right_panel to use shared layout
	data, eliminating duplicated / divergent calculations.
- Ensures main and messages always subtract right panel width consistently.
- Establishes single source of truth for vertical splits (main/messages) and
	horizontal splits (menu/right) improving maintainability.
- No external API changes; internal refactor + sizing correctness.
- Version bumped to 0.1.9.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.10 - 2025-10-07
- Added safety clamps to prevent zero or negative panel dimensions after
	layout refactor (main/messages/right). Avoids curses window creation errors
	when toggling panels into edge states (e.g., hiding both main and messages).
- Guarded module panel setup/redraw with minimum size enforcement.
- Internal-only stability fix; no API changes.
- Version bumped to 0.1.10.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.11 - 2025-10-07
- Introduced safe_addstr() helper in curse.py to clip text to current window
	bounds using getmaxyx() preventing addstr crashes on rapid resize or
	dimension race conditions.
- Replaced direct addstr calls for panel banner and splash screen drawing.
- Lays groundwork for future adoption across backend update methods.
- Version bumped to 0.1.11.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.

## 0.1.12 - 2025-10-07
- Adjusted right panel vertical sizing logic to mirror menu panel: spans full
	working vertical area beneath header and above footer + info, instead of
	being tied to main/messages split height.
- Provides consistent side-rail appearance and prevents uneven vertical gaps
	when only messages or main is toggled off.
- Internal layout refinement; no API changes.
- Version bumped to 0.1.12.
- Changes credited to GPT5 10-07-25.
